# Shinkansen-Travel-Experience

Time performance of the trains along with passenger information is published in a file named ‘Traveldata_train.csv’.  These passengers were later asked to provide their feedback on various parameters related to the travel along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report labeled ‘Surveydata_train.csv’

In the survey, each passenger was explicitly asked whether they were satisfied with their overall travel experience or not, and that is captured in the data of the survey report under the variable labeled ‘Overall_Experience’. 

**- The goal is to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train.**
